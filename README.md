# dot files

This project aims to be a multi-OS collection of templates of configuration files and Shell Script that help the users.
The Shell Scripts into this repository are a sort of libraries for the Shell, each with a specific purpose (`pacman.sh` -> better interface with `pacman`, etc.).
The Desktop Entries in this repository are intended to provide, where they may be missing (see KDE), the basic icons that an OS has.
